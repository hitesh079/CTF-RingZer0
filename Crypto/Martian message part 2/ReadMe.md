# Challenge - I think that's the key "fselkladfklklakl" KDERE2UNX1W1H96GYQNUSQT1KPGB
## My Approach:
When I started the challenge, I thought that this challenge would be using some of the old ciphers because of points of the challenge. With this in mind, I tried to solve it using Vigenère’s Cipher.
I went to https://cryptii.com/ because it has online implementation of many ciphers. There I looked for the implementation of Vigenère’s cipher. I replaced the text on the website with KDERE2UNX1W1H96GYQNUSQT1KPGB and the key with fselkladfklklakl.
