# Challenge - Finding out the flag from given sentence - xipak-comok-repuk-vanik-dytuk-dimyk-sinyx

## My Approach:

Wehn I started the challenge, I noticed that the format of the text is a little strange. 
I tried by putting the text onto google and from there I found out that this format is called BubbleBabble. Upon reading further I found out that this was a binary encoding technique designed by Antti Huima.
This technique uses consonants and vowels in alteration to encode binary data to pseudowords. 

Then I searched for BubbleBabble encoders on python and found this library on the interet https://pypi.org/project/bubblepy/ 

Once I had the library I tried to decode the given text and got the flag.
